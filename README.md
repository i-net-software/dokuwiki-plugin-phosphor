Phosphor
========

A plugin that makes use of the [phosphor framework](https://github.com/divergentmedia/phosphorframework) - the one that lets you create an image based codec video for your website - just as Apple used on its websites.

Syntax - Single Movie
------
```
{{phosphor> %BASEIMAGE%[?%PARAMS%]|%BACKGROUND%|%TITLE%}}

e.g

{{phosphor> de:products:helpdesk:mobile:ios:phosphor:createnewrequest:createnewrequest.jpg |background=de:products:helpdesk:mobile:ios:iphone-masked.png?300&background-inset-left=61px&background-inset-top=128px&content-frame-zoom=1&background-overlay=de:products:helpdesk:mobile:ios:iphone-masked-overlay.png |Hover Title}}
```

  * `%BASEIMAGE%` - is an the image generated by the phosphor app. In parallel there have to be all the additional files with their original names _in lowercase_
  * `%PARAMS%` - see table
  * `%BACKGROUND%` - another image that will be displayed as backdrop
  * `%TITLE%` - a hover hint

Name | What it does
-----|-------------
**class** | additional class to put on the root element
**speed** | a number that defines how fast the animation will run
**loop** | will loop the movie if set to "true"
**content-frame-zoom** | zoom factor of the inner movie that actually runs
**background** | an image where the movie frame will be embedded
**background-inset-left** | how far to push the movie frame from left to right
**background-inset-top** | how far to push the movie frame down
**background-overlay** | an optional overlay that will be put above the movie frame

Syntax - Multiple Movies
----
You can display a set of movies in a single frame as well. The syntax is like this:

```

<phosphor [%SIZE%] [%PARAMS%] [%CLASSNAME%]>

    <item %BASEIMAGE%[?%PARAMS%]|%TITLE%>
        %DISPLAYTEXT%
    </item>

    <item %BASEIMAGE%[?%PARAMS%]|%TITLE%>
        %DISPLAYTEXT%
    </item>

</phosphor>

```

  * `%SIZE%` - e.g. 56%x36%
  * `%PARAMS%` - see table
  * `%CLASSNAME%` - additional class to put on the root element
  * `%BASEIMAGE%` - is an the image generated by the phosphor app. In parallel there have to be all the additional files with their original names _in lowercase_
  * `%TITLE%` - a hover hint
